This is the develop.txt file on Develop.

In this workflow I have a master, a develop and then feature branches.
A feature branch is never merged directly with master
Rather than master, the feature branch is merged with develop 
Once there are enough features on the develop branch,
It is merged with the master with a corresponding version number.

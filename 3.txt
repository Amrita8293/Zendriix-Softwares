This is the third file with name 3.txt on feature2 branch.

In this workflow we have a master, a develop and then feature branches.
A feature branch in never merged directly with master
Rather than Master, the feature branch is merged with develop
Once there are enough features on the Develop branch,
It is merged with the Master with a corresponding version number.
